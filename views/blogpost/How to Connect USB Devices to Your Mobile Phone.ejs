                        <p class="blog-text-overview margin-top-bottom">Before attempting to connect a USB device to
                            your mobile phone, ensure that your device supports USB On-The-Go (OTG) functionality. Most
                            modern Android smartphones and tablets support OTG, allowing them to act as hosts for USB
                            devices. You can verify your device's compatibility by checking the specifications on the
                            manufacturer's website or consulting the user manual.</p>
